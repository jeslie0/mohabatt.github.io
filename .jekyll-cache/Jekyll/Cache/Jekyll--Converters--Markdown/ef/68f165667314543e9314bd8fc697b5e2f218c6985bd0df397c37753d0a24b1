I"‚<h1 class="title">About me</h1>

<p>My name is Mohabat and I am a mathematics PhD student at <a href="https://math.uwo.ca">The University of Western Ontario</a>. My doctoral supervisor is <a href="https://www.math.uwo.ca/faculty/hall/">Chris Hall</a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of algebraic graph theory, combinatorics, probability, topology, and category theory. I am especially interested in the connections between various mathematics disciplines and how they exist in symbiotic relationships. How one area illuminates another or how the language of one area is better suited to certain problems are some of the questions I think about. During my undergraduate degree at <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/">York University</a>, I completed a double major in mathematics and psychology. From the outset, I was interested in learning about a wide range of topics, always open to viewing things from a fresh perspective. When Iâ€™m not thinking about math, I enjoy taking long walks in nature with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/woodytheluckylab/">my dog</a>, reading (my favourite authors include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl">Viktor Frankl</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Matthiessen">Peter Matthiessen</a>, <a href="http://margaretatwood.ca/">Margaret Atwood</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce">James Joyce</a>, and many more), creating paintings, and spending time with my family. Iâ€™m always open to meet new people and discuss math so feel free to <a href="mailto:mtarkesh@uwo.ca">email me</a> with any questions you have about my experiences or if you just want to chat.</p>
