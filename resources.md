As a member of an underrepresented group in mathematics, I've found that it is useful for everyone to have access to resources to help them on their journey of mathematical exploration (and learning, in general). [Federico Ardila's](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/) beautiful [axioms](https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf) for doing mathematics provide an inspiring framework in which we can all strive to do mathematics equitably and joyously:

<span style = "color:#7986CB">Axiom 1.</span> Mathematical talent is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

<span style = "color:#7986CB">Axiom 2.</span> Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

<span style = "color:#7986CB">Axiom 3.</span> Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve thei r needs.

<span style = "color:#7986CB">Axiom 4.</span> Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.


Below I've included an amalgamation of resources I've come across over time[^1] that have helped me in some way, shape, or form. I hope it will do the same for all learners out there. Please [contact me](mailto:mtarkesh@uwo.ca) if you have any suggestions to add to this list.

## Toolkit
* For those who want to jump into typing math and collaborating with others online, [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) is a friendly introduction to the math typesetting language $\LaTeX$ that hosts everything right in your browser (no need to install any packages!). It also has [templates](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates) for common document and presentation types, as well as helpful [tutorials](
https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials) to help get started. 
	- If you want to install $\LaTeX$ on your machine and typeset math offline (which I recommend you try), I suggest using the text editor [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). It can be used for $\LaTeX$ as well as a host of other languages.
	- Information about installing $\LaTeX$ can be found [here](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).
	- A quick way to know how to typeset a certain mathematical symbol in $\LaTeX$ is to use [detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) to draw out the symbol. The program will then present you with typeset options from which to choose.
* If you prefer to collaborate through handwriting (imagine standing at a blackboard with your peers), the [Scribble](https://scribbletogether.com/) app lets you share a whiteboard with anyone through the [app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scribble-together-shared-internet-whiteboard/id1266088066) and anyone can view a shared whiteboard through their browser. It is easy to use and the infinite white space provides the perfect landing ground for new ideas.
* For collaboration that can be succinctly done through some diagrams, the online [tikzcd](https://tikzcd.yichuanshen.de/) editor is great for this. You can draw any diagram, share the link and edit it with others in real-time. You can even extract the $\LaTeX$ code to use it later.
* For collaboration that needs some coding (read: [Sage](https://www.sagemath.org/)), [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/app) is an interactive environment that can help you get started coding math right away - again, without the need for installing any packages on your machine. Although it can be a little slow at times, it is great for mini computations and jotting down quick and short ideas.
* My personal notetaking outside of collaborations is a combination of pen-and-paper (and post-its!), [GoodNotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/), and [Notability](https://www.gingerlabs.com/). The latter two are practically interchangeable and its utility highly depends on personal preference. 
* For task management and all things organizational, I use a combination of [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). More on this will be forthcoming in a blog post.


## Blogs and expositions
* One of my all-time favourite math blogs is [Tai-Danae Bradley's](https://twitter.com/math3ma) blog [Math3ma](https://www.math3ma.com/). It is a huge source of friendly expositions about important math topics, ranging from [Galois theory](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-galois-theory-anyway) all the way to [enriched category theory](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/warming-up-to-enriched-category-theory-1). I highly recommend you check it out.
	- As an aside, Bradley and coauthors have penned a book called [_"Topology: A Categorical Approach"_](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/topology-book) that takes traditional point-set topology and infuses it with the language of category theory. An enjoyable read for those familiar with point-set topology and interested in delving into category theory and its applications.
* Terence Tao's blog [_"What's new?"_]((https://terrytao.wordpress.com/)) has a wealth of resources for mathematicians at all stages of their journey. He also provides regular research updates that are highly accessible.
* Keith Conrad's [expository papers](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/) consist of rigorous, understandable, and complete expositions on important topics in algebra and analysis. It has more of an emphasis on algebra, with many papers on elementary and algebraic number theory.
* [Emily Riehl's](https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/#exposition) expository writings are vital for anyone interested in category theory. Her category theory book, [_"Category Theory in Context"_](https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context/) is a wonderful introduction to the subject, with an emphasis on drawing examples from all areas of mathematics.
* The [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) has a plethora of expositions, although I mostly use it for introductions and descriptions of topics in [category theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/search?query=category+theory). 
* Last but definitely not least, the [arXiV](https://arxiv.org/archive/math): for all mathematical pre-prints, past, and current research.
